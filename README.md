# Modeling-and-Prediction-of-CO2-Emissions-Using-machine-learning-model
This study aims to develop a machine learning model to test and identify significant indicators with a high impact on carbon emissions. To reduce analytical error, we
focused on Carbon emission per capita rather than carbon emission. We used Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Multi-layer Perceptron. The Random Forest Regression algorithm performed best and was used for modeling and predicting CO2 emissions.
